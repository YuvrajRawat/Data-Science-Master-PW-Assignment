    "Question: What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "Answer: The three measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a \n",
    "    dataset?\n",
    "Answer: The mean is the average value of a dataset, the median is the middle value when the dataset is arranged in ascending or \n",
    "    descending order, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value. They provide a single value that represents the \n",
    "    center or typical value of the dataset.\n",

    "Question: Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data: [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,\n",
    "                                                                                     178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]\n",
    "Answer:\n",

    "Mean: 177.8125\n",
    "Median: 177.5\n",

    "Question: Find the standard deviation for the given data: [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,\n",
    "        176.5]\n",
    "Answer: Approximately 1.689 (rounded to three decimal places).\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe the spread of a \n",
    "    dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "Answer: Measures of dispersion provide information about how spread out the values in a dataset are from the central tendency \n",
    "    measures. For example, a larger range, variance, or standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    "Answer: A Venn diagram is a graphical representation of the relationships between different sets of data, typically consisting \n",
    "    of overlapping circles or other shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: For the two given sets A = {2,3,4,5,6,7} & B = {0,2,6,8,10}, find:\n",
    "(i) A ∩ B\n",
    "(ii) A ⋃ B\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "(i) A ∩ B (intersection): {2, 6}\n",
    "(ii) A ⋃ B (union): {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "Answer: Skewness in data refers to the asymmetry in the distribution of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?\n",
    "Answer: If a data is right skewed, the median will be less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "Answer: Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together, while correlation measures the strength and \n",
    "    direction of the linear relationship between two variables. They are used to analyze the relationship between variables in \n",
    "    statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a dataset.\n",
    "Answer: The formula for calculating the sample mean is: Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values). For example, if the \n",
    "        dataset is {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, then the mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?\n",
    "Answer: For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: How is covariance different from correlation?\n",
    "Answer: Covariance measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables along with the extent to which they \n",
    "    change together, whereas correlation is a standardized measure representing the strength and direction of the linear \n",
    "    relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "Answer: Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency, such as the mean, pulling it towards the direction of \n",
    "    the outlier. They can also impact measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation, making them \n",
    "    larger or smaller depending on the position of the outlier relative to the other data points. For example, in a dataset of\n",
    "    exam scores where most students scored between 60 and 80, but one student scored 95, the mean would be pulled towards 95, \n",
    "    and the standard deviation might increase due to the increased spread caused by the outlier."
