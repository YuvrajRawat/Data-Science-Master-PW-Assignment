    "1. Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. Each thread represents \n",

    "join: The join method blocks the execution of the calling thread until the thread on which it is called terminates.\n",
    "isAlive: The isAlive method returns True if the thread is alive (i.e., it has been started but not yet terminated), otherwise \n",
    "    returns False."
