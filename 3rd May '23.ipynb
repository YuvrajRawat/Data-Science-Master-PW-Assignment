    "Q1. The role of feature selection in anomaly detection:\n",
    "Feature selection is crucial in anomaly detection because it helps in identifying and using the most relevant features \n",
    "(variables) to distinguish between normal and anomalous data points. Selecting the right features can lead to more accurate and \n",
    "efficient anomaly detection models by reducing noise, dimensionality, and computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Common evaluation metrics for anomaly detection algorithms:\n",
    "Common evaluation metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positive (TP): Anomalous cases correctly classified as anomalies.\n",
    "True Negative (TN): Normal cases correctly classified as normal.\n",
    "False Positive (FP): Normal cases incorrectly classified as anomalies.\n",
    "False Negative (FN): Anomalous cases incorrectly classified as normal.\n",
    "Metrics derived from these include:\n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "Recall (Sensitivity) = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC)\n",
    "Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUC-PR)\n",
    "Q3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\n",
    "DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm used for grouping data points based on their density in the feature space. It \n",
    "works by defining core points, border points, and noise points within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Epsilon parameter's effect on DBSCAN:\n",
    "The epsilon parameter, along with the minimum number of points (MinPts), determines the core points and, consequently, the \n",
    "clusters formed by DBSCAN. A smaller epsilon leads to denser clusters, and anomalies may not be detected. Conversely, a larger \n",
    "epsilon may result in more noise points being labeled as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Core, border, and noise points in DBSCAN:\n",
    "\n",
    "Core points are data points with at least MinPts data points in their epsilon-neighborhood.\n",
    "Border points are not core points but have at least one core point in their epsilon-neighborhood.\n",
    "Noise points are neither core nor border points and do not belong to any cluster. Noise points can represent anomalies in the \n",
    "data.\n",
    "Q6. DBSCAN's role in anomaly detection:\n",
    "DBSCAN can be used for anomaly detection by considering noise points as anomalies. The key parameters involved are epsilon \n",
    "(determining neighborhood size) and MinPts (minimum points for core points). Noise points that do not belong to any cluster are \n",
    "considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. The make_circles package in scikit-learn:\n",
    "The make_circles function in scikit-learn is used to generate a synthetic dataset consisting of data points arranged in \n",
    "concentric circles. It's often used for testing and illustrating clustering and classification algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Local outliers vs. global outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Local outliers are anomalies that are isolated within small local regions of the dataset.\n",
    "Global outliers are anomalies that deviate significantly from the majority of data points across the entire dataset. They are \n",
    "outliers in a global context.\n",
    "Q9. Detecting local outliers using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm:\n",
    "LOF measures the density of a data point's local neighborhood relative to the densities of its neighbors. Points with \n",
    "significantly lower density than their neighbors are considered local outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Detecting global outliers using the Isolation Forest algorithm:\n",
    "The Isolation Forest algorithm isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning the data and building decision trees. Anomalies are \n",
    "those data points that require fewer partitions (shorter paths) to be isolated, making them global outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. Real-world applications for local and global outlier detection:\n",
    "- Local outlier detection is suitable for applications like fraud detection, where anomalies may be localized patterns or \n",
    "specific instances of fraud in a large dataset.\n",
    "- Global outlier detection is useful in applications such as quality control, where anomalies are rare, but their impact is \n",
    "widespread across the entire dataset."
