    "assumptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of clustering algorithms, each with its own approach and underlying assumptions. Some common types \n",
    "include:\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means Clustering: Divides data into non-overlapping clusters based on distances between data points and cluster centroids. \n",
    "    Assumes that clusters are spherical and equally sized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting clusters. No assumption about \n",
    "    cluster shape or size is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Identifies clusters based on density of data points. It \n",
    "    doesn't assume spherical clusters and can handle noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agglomerative Clustering: Hierarchical clustering approach that starts with individual data points as clusters and merges them \n",
    "    iteratively based on certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Assumes data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. It estimates the parameters \n",
    "    of these distributions, including means and covariances.\n",
    "\n",

    "    shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral Clustering: Utilizes the eigenvalues of similarity matrices to find clusters. It is particularly useful for non-convex \n",
    "    and complexly shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy Clustering (Fuzzy C-Means): Allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership, rather \n",
    "    than a hard assignment to a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): Uses a neural network-like structure to map data onto a grid, where nearby neurons represent similar\n",
    "    data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density Peak Clustering: Identifies clusters by finding density peaks and their associated data points.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. What is K-means clustering, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Initialization: Choose the number of clusters (K) and randomly initialize K cluster centroids (points in the feature space).\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid based on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update: Recalculate the centroids of the clusters by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are iteratively performed until convergence, where either the centroids no longer change significantly or \n",
    "    a predetermined number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of K-means clustering is a set of K clusters with their respective centroids, and each data point is assigned to the \n",
    "nearest centroid. K-means seeks to minimize the within-cluster sum of squared distances, making it sensitive to the initial \n",

    "\n",
    "Sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, which can lead to different results.\n",
    "Assumes clusters are spherical, equally sized, and have similar density.\n",
    "Struggles with non-convex or irregularly shaped clusters.\n",
    "Can be affected by outliers.\n",
    "Requires specifying the number of clusters (K) in advance, which is not always known.\n",
